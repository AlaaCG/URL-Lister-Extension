## How to use
you can name the file, click get Links and a .urls file will be downloaded, that you can use to open the tabs back.

## Why? 
I found this useful as I often want to save many pages, Solution pages, search pages, Documents and other stuff, to go back to or to save them, you can also share the .urls

- This isn't Published as I didn't wanna pay the 5$ developer fees for an extension no one wants, so â†“

## Installation

Download the repositry in a folder, go to your browser's extension settings, Click Load Unpacked and choose the folder 

- You might Have to enable developer tools to be able to load unpacked
